=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for attributes were not provided, so common types like
      INTEGER for IDs/counts, TEXT for names/codes/addresses, DATE for
      dates, and BOOLEAN for yes/no flags were assumed.
    - No `NOT NULL` constraints were applied to non-key attributes
      as no total participation (double lines) was indicated for
      attributes, nor were there any explicit `NOT NULL` markings.
- Explanation:
    - Each strong entity (Apartment_Buildings, Apartments, Guests,
      Apartment_Bookings, View_Unit_Status) is mapped to its own table.
    - Attributes of each entity are included as columns in their
      respective tables.
    - Underlined attributes (building_id, apt_id, guest_id,
      apt_booking_id, status_date) are designated as primary keys
      for their entities.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - `facility_code` is considered the partial key for
      `Apartment_Facilities` because it's the only attribute of this
      weak entity, and weak entities require a discriminator for their
      primary key in conjunction with the owner's primary key.
- Explanation:
    - The `Apartment_Facilities` entity, being a weak entity
      (indicated by the double rectangle), is mapped to a new table.
    - Its primary key is a composite of its owner's (Apartments) primary
      key (`apt_id`) and its own partial key (`facility_code`).
    - A foreign key (`apt_id`) is added to `Apartment_Facilities`
      referencing the `Apartments` table.
    - `ON DELETE CASCADE` is specified for this foreign key, as required
      for weak entity relationships.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The diagram does not show total participation (double lines)
      for the N-side of any 1:N relationships, so `NOT NULL` was
      not added to the foreign key columns.
- Explanation:
    - Foreign keys are added to represent all 1:N relationships.
    - For the `Apartment_Buildings` (1) to `Apartments` (N)
      relationship, `building_id` (PK of `Apartment_Buildings`)
      is added as an FK in the `Apartments` table.
    - For the `Apartments` (1) to `Apartment_Bookings` (N)
      relationship, `apt_id` (PK of `Apartments`) is added as an FK
      in the `Apartment_Bookings` table.
    - For the `Guests` (1) to `Apartment_Bookings` (N) relationship,
      `guest_id` (PK of `Guests`) is added as an FK in the
      `Apartment_Bookings` table.
    - For the `Apartments` (1) to `View_Unit_Status` (N) relationship,
      `apt_id` (PK of `Apartments`) is added as an FK in the
      `View_Unit_Status` table.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for attributes were inferred based on common usage (e.g., `id` as INTEGER, `name` as TEXT, `date` as DATE, `tonnage`, `killed`, `injured` as INTEGER). No explicit types were provided in the diagram.
    - All entities are considered strong as there are no double rectangles and all have an explicitly underlined primary key.
- Explanation:
    - Three tables (`battle`, `ship`, `death`) were created, corresponding to the strong entities identified in the ER diagram.
    - Each table includes all simple attributes connected to its respective entity.
    - The `id` attribute for each entity, being underlined with a solid line, was designated as the PRIMARY KEY.
    - Constraints are declared inline at the bottom of each table definition.

- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No weak entities were identified in the diagram (no double rectangles or dashed underlines for partial keys).
- Explanation:

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The text ""battle.id (N:1)"" within the `ship.lost_in_battle` diamond and ""ship.id (N:1)"" within `death.caused_by_ship_id` are interpreted as explicit instructions to add foreign keys, with the `(N:1)` indicating the direction of the foreign key (from N-side to 1-side).
    - No total participation (double lines) was indicated for these relationships, so foreign keys are nullable by default.
- Explanation:
    - Two 1:N relationships were identified: `ship.lost_in_battle` (battle 1:N ship) and `death.caused_by_ship_id` (ship 1:N death).
    - For `ship.lost_in_battle`, the primary key of `battle` (`id`) is added as a foreign key (`battle_id`) to the `ship` table (the 'N' side).
    - For `death.caused_by_ship_id`, the primary key of `ship` (`id`) is added as a foreign key (`ship_id`) to the `death` table (the 'N' side).
    - The creation order of tables was adjusted: `battle` first, then `ship` (because it references `battle`), then `death` (because it references `ship`) to ensure referenced tables exist before their foreign keys are created.
    - Foreign key constraints are added at the end of the table definitions.

- Cardinality: N:1, from body_builder to people (meaning many body_builder can be associated with one people, and one people can be associated with many body_builder).
- Notation: Chen Notation

=== STEP 1 — STRONG ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Place VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Date DATE,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE body_builder (
    Body_Builder_ID INTEGER,
    Snatch NUMERIC,
    Clean_Jerk NUMERIC,
    Total NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (Body_Builder_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for attributes like Name, Birth_Place, Birth_Date, Height,
      Weight, Snatch, Clean_Jerk, and Total were inferred
      based on common database practices, as they were not
      explicitly provided in the diagram.
    - `People_ID` and `Body_Builder_ID` are assumed to be INTEGER.
    - `Name` and `Birth_Place` are assumed to be VARCHAR(255).
    - `Birth_Date` is assumed to be DATE.
    - `Height`, `Weight`, `Snatch`, `Clean_Jerk`, `Total` are assumed to be
      NUMERIC for potential decimal values.
- Explanation
    - Two strong entities, 'people' and 'body_builder', were
      identified and mapped to respective tables.
    - All simple attributes directly associated with each entity
      were included as columns in their corresponding tables.
    - The underlined attributes, `People_ID` for 'people' and
      `Body_Builder_ID` for 'body_builder', were designated
      as the primary keys for their respective tables.

=== STEP 2 — WEAK ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Place VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Date DATE,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE body_builder (
    Body_Builder_ID INTEGER,
    Snatch NUMERIC,
    Clean_Jerk NUMERIC,
    Total NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (Body_Builder_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No weak entities were identified in the ER diagram
      as there are no double-lined rectangles or dashed
      underlined attributes to indicate partial keys.
- Explanation
    - Since no weak entities were present in the diagram, no
      SQL changes were made in this step. The SQL code
      remains the same as Step 1.

=== STEP 3 — BINARY 1:1 (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Place VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Date DATE,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE body_builder (
    Body_Builder_ID INTEGER,
    Snatch NUMERIC,
    Clean_Jerk NUMERIC,
    Total NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (Body_Builder_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The relationship between 'people' and 'body_builder' is explicitly
      marked as N:1, not 1:1.
- Explanation
    - The diagram does not show any binary 1:1 relationships.
      Therefore, no SQL changes were required in this step,
      and the code remains identical to the previous step.

=== STEP 4 — BINARY 1:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Place VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Date DATE,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE body_builder (
    Body_Builder_ID INTEGER,
    Snatch NUMERIC,
    Clean_Jerk NUMERIC,
    Total NUMERIC,
    People_ID INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Body_Builder_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (People_ID) REFERENCES people (People_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The cardinality (N:1) and the relationship text
      (`body_builder.People_ID <-> people.People_ID`)
      clearly indicate that `People_ID` from the `people`
      entity should be a foreign key in the `body_builder`
      entity.
    - No explicit total participation for `body_builder` in the
      relationship with `people` was indicated in the diagram.
      Thus, the `People_ID` foreign key in `body_builder` is
      not marked as `NOT NULL`. This implies a body builder
      might not be associated with a person, or the
      association is optional.
- Explanation
    - A binary 1:N relationship exists where 'people' is on the
      '1' side and 'body_builder' is on the 'N' side.
    - Following the rules for 1:N relationships, the primary
      key of the '1' side (`People_ID` from 'people') was
      added as a foreign key (`People_ID`) in the 'N' side
      ('body_builder') table.
    - The foreign key constraint `FOREIGN KEY (People_ID)
      REFERENCES people (People_ID)` was added to the
      `body_builder` table.
    - The `people` table is created before the `body_builder`
      table, ensuring that the referenced table exists
      before the foreign key is defined.

=== STEP 5 — BINARY M:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Place VARCHAR(255),
    Birth_Date DATE,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE body_builder (
    Body_Builder_ID INTEGER,
    Snatch NUMERIC,
    Clean_Jerk NUMERIC,
    Total NUMERIC,
    People_ID INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Body_Builder_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (People_ID) REFERENCES people (People_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 5===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The diagram explicitly shows a 1:N relationship (N:1 from
      body_builder to people), not an M:N relationship.
- Explanation
    - No binary M:N relationships were identified in the ER
      diagram. Therefore, no new join tables were created
      and no SQL changes were made in this step. The SQL
      code remains the same as Step 4."

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types (INTEGER, TEXT, TIMESTAMP) were chosen based on common
      database practices and attribute names, as they were not explicitly
      provided in the diagram.
    - `Score` is assumed to be an `INTEGER`.
    - `Time_of_purchase` is assumed to be a `TIMESTAMP`.
    - No attributes indicated total participation (double lines),
      so `NOT NULL` is only applied to primary key components.
- Explanation:
    - Two strong entities, `shop` and `member`, were identified.
    - A table was created for each strong entity.
    - All simple attributes associated with each strong entity were included
      as columns in their respective tables.
    - The attributes `Shop_ID` and `Member_ID`, which were explicitly
      underlined with a solid line, were designated as the primary keys
      for `shop` and `member` tables, respectively.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The `HH_ID` for `happy_hour` and `happy_hour_member` are distinct partial
      keys within their respective weak entities.
    - `Total_amount` is assumed to be a `DECIMAL` for financial values.
- Explanation:
    - The `happy_hour` entity was identified as a weak entity,
      dependent on `shop` through an identifying relationship
      (`happy_hour_Shop_ID -> shop.Shop_ID (N:1)`).
    - Its primary key is a composite of `shop`'s primary key (`Shop_ID`)
      and its own partial key (`HH_ID`).
    - A foreign key `Shop_ID` was added, referencing `shop(Shop_ID)`,
      with `ON DELETE CASCADE` as it's an identifying relationship.
    - The `happy_hour_member` entity was identified as a weak entity,
      dependent on `member` through an identifying relationship
      (`identifying relation happy_hour_member member (N:1)`).
    - Its primary key is a composite of `member`'s primary key (`Member_ID`)
      and its own partial key (`HH_ID`).
    - A foreign key `Member_ID` was added, referencing `member(Member_ID)`,
      with `ON DELETE CASCADE` for the identifying relationship.
    - All primary key components for weak entities are marked `NOT NULL`.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No 1:1 relationships were explicitly identified in the ER diagram
      that were not already handled as part of identifying relationships
      for weak entities.
- Explanation:
    - No binary 1:1 non-identifying relationships were present in the diagram,
      so no SQL changes were made in this step. The existing SQL from
      Step 2 is carried over.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The 1:N relationships in this diagram (`shop` to `happy_hour` and
      `member` to `happy_hour_member`) are identifying relationships
      for weak entities.
- Explanation:
    - The 1:N relationships observed in the diagram are part of the
      identifying relationships for the weak entities (`happy_hour` and
      `happy_hour_member`). These were already handled in Step 2 by
      incorporating the primary key of the '1'-side entity as part of
      the composite primary key and a foreign key in the 'N'-side
      (weak) entity.
    - No new non-identifying 1:N relationships were found, so no
      additional SQL changes were made in this step. The SQL remains
      the same as Step 2.

CREATE TABLE buildings (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(255),
    Status VARCHAR(255),
    Height INT,

    Assets_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    Market_Value_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for attributes were inferred based on common usage and names,
      e.g., `id` as INT, `name` as VARCHAR(255), billion amounts as NUMERIC(10, 2),
      `Height` and `Stories` as INT.
    - Attribute lengths for VARCHAR types are assumed to be 255
      as no specific lengths were provided.
- Explanation:
    - Two strong entities, `buildings` and `Companies`, were identified.
    - A table was created for each strong entity, including all their simple attributes.
    - The `id` attribute for both `buildings` and `Companies` was explicitly
      underlined in the diagram, indicating it as the primary key.
    - Primary key attributes are set to `NOT NULL` as per standard practice.
    - All primary key constraints are defined at the end of the column list.

=== STEP 2 — WEAK ENTITIES (SQL) ===

    Assets_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    Market_Value_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)

CREATE TABLE Office_locations (

    FOREIGN KEY (buildings_id) REFERENCES buildings (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (companies_id) REFERENCES Companies (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - `Office_locations` is a weak entity owned by two strong entities,
      `buildings` and `Companies`, through identifying relationships.
      This means its existence depends on both owners.
    - The `move_in_year` attribute is a partial key.
- Explanation:
    - The `Office_locations` entity is a weak entity, identified by its
      owners' primary keys and its own partial key `move_in_year`.
    - It has foreign keys `buildings_id` and `companies_id`, which reference
      the `id` columns of the `buildings` and `Companies` tables, respectively.
    - These foreign keys are part of the composite primary key of `Office_locations`.
    - Both `buildings_id` and `companies_id` are `NOT NULL` because a weak
      entity implicitly has total participation in its identifying relationships.
    - `ON DELETE CASCADE` is applied to the foreign keys, as required for
      weak entities, ensuring that if an owner is deleted, the
      dependent weak entity instances are also deleted.
    - The primary key of `Office_locations` is a composite key consisting
      of `buildings_id`, `companies_id`, and `move_in_year`.

=== STEP 3 — BINARY 1:1 (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE buildings (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(255),
    Status VARCHAR(255),

CREATE TABLE Office_locations (
    buildings_id INT NOT NULL,
    companies_id INT NOT NULL,
    move_in_year INT NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (buildings_id, companies_id, move_in_year),
    FOREIGN KEY (buildings_id) REFERENCES buildings (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (companies_id) REFERENCES Companies (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No 1:1 binary relationships were identified in the ER diagram.
- Explanation:
    - No new SQL statements are generated in this step as the ER diagram does
      not contain any explicit 1:1 binary relationships between entities.

=== STEP 4 — BINARY 1:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE buildings (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(255),
    Status VARCHAR(255),
    Height INT,
    Stories INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE Companies (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    Industry VARCHAR(255),
    Profits_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    Headquarters VARCHAR(255),
    Sales_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    Assets_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    Market_Value_billion NUMERIC(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE Office_locations (
    buildings_id INT NOT NULL,
    companies_id INT NOT NULL,
    move_in_year INT NOT NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY (buildings_id) REFERENCES buildings (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (companies_id) REFERENCES Companies (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The 1:N relationships in the diagram (between `buildings` and
      `Office_locations`, and between `Companies` and `Office_locations`)
      are identifying relationships for a weak entity.
- Explanation:
    - The 1:N relationships observed in the diagram involve the weak entity
      `Office_locations`. These relationships are treated as identifying
      relationships, and their mapping (foreign keys from owner to weak entity,
      and inclusion in the weak entity's composite primary key)
      was already handled in Step 2.
    - Therefore, no additional SQL is generated in this step. This step
      primarily applies to non-identifying 1:N relationships between
      strong entities, which are not present in this diagram.

=== STEP 5 — BINARY M:N (SQL) ===

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 5===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No M:N binary relationships were identified in the ER diagram.
- Explanation:

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
  - Data types were inferred based on attribute names (e.g., `_id` as INT,
    `date_` as DATE, `amount_` as DECIMAL, `_yn` as BOOLEAN).
  - `gender_mf` is assumed to be CHAR(1).
  - No explicit data type was given in the diagram.
- Explanation:
  - Each strong entity (rectangle) is mapped to a SQL `CREATE TABLE` statement.
  - Attributes connected to entities (ovals) are mapped as columns in their
    respective tables.
  - Attributes explicitly underlined (solid line) are designated as primary keys.
  - `View_Product_Availability` and `Products_Booked` do not have any
    underlined attributes. Following the strict rules, no primary key is
    defined for them at this step.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
  - The diagram's (N:1) cardinality notation, where 'N' is on the M-side
    of the relationship and '1' is on the 1-side, combined with an
    accompanying (1,1) (min, max) notation near the N-side entity, is
    interpreted as total participation on the M-side. This means the foreign
    key column on the M-side is declared `NOT NULL`.
  - The ordering of `CREATE TABLE` statements was adjusted to ensure that
    tables referenced by foreign keys are created before the tables containing
    those foreign keys.
- Explanation:
  - All identified binary 1:N relationships are mapped by adding the
    primary key of the '1'-side entity as a foreign key column in the 'N'-side
    entity's table.
  - Foreign key columns are marked `NOT NULL` due to the interpretation
    of total participation from the (min, max) cardinality notation on the 'N'
    side (e.g., `(N:1)` with `(1,1)` near the `N` entity implies total
    participation).
  - The tables `View_Product_Availability` and `Products_Booked` still do
    not have explicitly defined primary keys, as no attributes were underlined
    in the diagram for these entities, and they are not identified as weak
    entities. This adheres strictly to the rule of using only explicit diagram
    features for key definitions.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for attributes are assumed based on common database practices (e.g., INTEGER for IDs and counts, VARCHAR for names and locations, etc.).
    - `Shop_ID` and `Employee_ID` are single-attribute primary keys; thus, `PRIMARY KEY` is added inline as per the rule: ""If only one attribute is underlined for an entity, add the words PRIMARY KEY next to that attribute"".
- Explanation:
    - The `shop` and `employee` entities are strong entities, identified by their respective primary keys `Shop_ID` and `Employee_ID`.
    - Each strong entity is mapped to a `CREATE TABLE` statement with its simple attributes.

    Bonus NUMERIC(10, 2),
    PRIMARY KEY (Employee_ID, Year_awarded),
    FOREIGN KEY (Employee_ID) REFERENCES employee (Employee_ID) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - For the `hiring` weak entity, no dashed-underlined partial key was explicitly shown in the diagram. Following the rule ""composite PK includes owner PK + weak key"" and to allow for multiple `hiring` records per `shop` (implied by 1:N), it is assumed that `Start_from` and `Is_full_time` (all its own attributes) collectively act as the distinguishing part of the composite primary key.
    - All attributes forming a primary key are implicitly `NOT NULL`. Explicit `NOT NULL` is added for clarity.
    - `DATE` is chosen for `Start_from` as it represents a specific starting point. `INTEGER` is chosen for `Year_awarded` as it's specifically ""Year_awarded"". `NUMERIC(10, 2)` for `Bonus` allows for decimal values.
- Explanation:
    - The `hiring` and `evaluation` entities are weak entities.
    - For `hiring`, `Shop_ID` (the primary key of its owner, `shop`) is included as a foreign key and is part of the composite primary key. The attributes `Start_from` and `Is_full_time` are also included in the composite primary key with `Shop_ID` to uniquely identify each `hiring` instance, as no explicit partial key was given. `Shop_ID` is `NOT NULL` because weak entities have total participation in their identifying relationship.
    - For `evaluation`, `Employee_ID` (the primary key of its owner, `employee`) is included as a foreign key and is part of the composite primary key. `Year_awarded` is its dashed-underlined partial key and is also part of the composite primary key. `Employee_ID` and `Year_awarded` are `NOT NULL`.
    - Both foreign keys (`Shop_ID` in `hiring` and `Employee_ID` in `evaluation`) have `ON DELETE CASCADE` to maintain referential integrity, as required for weak entities.
    - The `shop` and `employee` tables are defined before `hiring` and `evaluation` to satisfy foreign key dependencies.

=== STEP 1 — STRONG ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Date_of_Birth DATE,

    Entrepreneur_ID INTEGER,
    Money_Requested NUMERIC,
    Company VARCHAR(255),
    Investor VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (Entrepreneur_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for attributes (e.g., INTEGER for IDs, VARCHAR for names,
      NUMERIC for measurements/money, DATE for dates) were inferred as
      they were not explicitly provided in the diagram.
    - `People_ID` and `Entrepreneur_ID` are recognized as primary keys
      due to their solid underlining in the diagram.
- Explanation:
    - Two tables, `people` and `entrepreneur`, are created based on the
      strong entities identified in the ER diagram.
    - All simple attributes associated with each entity are included as
      columns in their respective tables.
    - Primary key constraints are applied to `People_ID` in the `people`
      table and `Entrepreneur_ID` in the `entrepreneur` table, as per
      the underlining in the diagram.

=== STEP 2 — WEAK ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Date_of_Birth DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE entrepreneur (
    Entrepreneur_ID INTEGER,
    Money_Requested NUMERIC,
    Company VARCHAR(255),
    Investor VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (Entrepreneur_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No weak entities are present in the provided ER diagram. Weak entities
      are typically represented by double rectangles and connected to their
      owner via a double-diamond relationship.
- Explanation:
    - This step results in no changes to the SQL code as no weak entities
      were identified in the ER diagram.

=== STEP 3 — BINARY 1:1 (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Date_of_Birth DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE entrepreneur (
    Entrepreneur_ID INTEGER,
    Money_Requested NUMERIC,
    Company VARCHAR(255),
    Investor VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (Entrepreneur_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - There are no 1:1 binary relationships explicitly depicted in the diagram.
      The relationship between `people` and `entrepreneur` is N:1.
- Explanation:
    - This step results in no changes to the SQL code as no 1:1 relationships
      were identified in the ER diagram.

=== STEP 4 — BINARY 1:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Date_of_Birth DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE entrepreneur (
    Entrepreneur_ID INTEGER,
    Money_Requested NUMERIC,
    Company VARCHAR(255),
    Investor VARCHAR(255),
    People_ID INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Entrepreneur_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (People_ID) REFERENCES people (People_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Participation constraints (e.g., total participation denoted by
      double lines) are not explicitly shown in the diagram. Therefore,
      the foreign key `People_ID` in the `entrepreneur` table is not
      marked as `NOT NULL`.
- Explanation:
    - A 1:N relationship exists between `people` (1-side) and `entrepreneur`
      (N-side).
    - According to the rules, the primary key of the 1-side entity (`People_ID`
      from `people`) is added as a foreign key to the N-side entity
      (`entrepreneur`).
    - The diagram explicitly shows `entrepreneur.People_ID <-> people.People_ID`
      within the relationship diamond, confirming that `People_ID` is the
      linking attribute within the `entrepreneur` entity.
    - The `people` table is created before the `entrepreneur` table because
      `entrepreneur` references `people`.

=== STEP 5 — BINARY M:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE people (
    People_ID INTEGER,
    Height NUMERIC,
    Weight NUMERIC,
    Name VARCHAR(255),
    Date_of_Birth DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (People_ID)

    Company VARCHAR(255),
    Investor VARCHAR(255),
    People_ID INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Entrepreneur_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (People_ID) REFERENCES people (People_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 5===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No many-to-many (M:N) relationships are depicted in the provided
      ER diagram.
- Explanation:
    - This step results in no changes to the SQL code as no M:N relationships
      were identified, meaning no new join tables are required."

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Total participation for the foreign keys (`Film_ID`, `Market_ID`) in
      `film_market_estimation` is assumed because the relationship text
      (`film_market_estimation.Film_ID -> film.Film_ID (N:1)` and
      `film_market_estimation.Market_ID -> market.Market_ID (N:1)`) implies
      that an estimation must refer to a film and a market. Thus, `NOT NULL`
      is applied to these foreign key columns.
- Explanation:
    - Two 1:N relationships were identified:
        1. `film` (1) to `film_market_estimation` (N): The primary key
           `Film_ID` from the '1'-side entity (`film`) is added as a
           foreign key in the 'N'-side entity (`film_market_estimation`).
        2. `market` (1) to `film_market_estimation` (N): The primary key
           `Market_ID` from the '1'-side entity (`market`) is added as a
           foreign key in the 'N'-side entity (`film_market_estimation`).
    - The `film` and `market` tables are created before

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types (INT, NUMERIC, TEXT) were chosen based on common
      practices and attribute names, as specific types were not
      provided in the visual cues.
- Explanation:
    - The `people` entity is identified as a strong entity because
      it is represented by a single rectangle.
    - Its attributes `People_ID`, `Height`, `Age`, `Hometown`,
      and `Name` are directly mapped as columns in the `people` table.
    - `People_ID` is underlined in the diagram, indicating it is
      the primary key, and thus a `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is applied.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - `Gymnast_ID` is inferred as the partial key for the `gymnast`
      entity from the relationship diamond text `gymnast.Gymnast_ID`.
    - Data type for `Gymnast_ID` is assumed to be `INT`.
- Explanation:
    - The `gymnast` entity is identified as a weak entity by its
      double-rectangle representation.
    - As per the rules for weak entities, its table includes its
      own attributes (`Vault_Points`, `Rings_Points`, etc.)
      and the primary key of its owner entity, `people`.
    - The partial key `Gymnast_ID` (inferred) combined with the
      owner's primary key `People_ID` forms the composite primary key
      for the `gymnast` table: `PRIMARY KEY(People_ID, Gymnast_ID)`.
    - A foreign key `People_ID` is established, referencing `people(People_ID)`,
      with `ON DELETE CASCADE` to ensure referential integrity when
      an owner `people` record is deleted.
    - The double line connecting `gymnast` to the relationship indicates
      total participation, meaning every `gymnast` must be associated
      with a `people` entity. This implies `People_ID` (as the foreign key)
      must be `NOT NULL`. `Gymnast_ID` is also `NOT NULL` as part of the PK.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - None.
- Explanation:
    - The relationship between `people` and `gymnast` is a 1:N
      relationship, with `people` on the '1' side and `gymnast`
      on the 'N' side.
    - The rule for 1:N relationships is to place the PK of the
      1-side entity as an FK in the N-side entity.
    - This mapping was already performed in Step 2, where `People_ID`
      from `people` was included in the `gymnast` table as part of
      its composite primary key and as a foreign key.
    - `gymnast` has total participation in this relationship, which
      requires the FK (`People_ID` in `gymnast`) to be `NOT NULL`.
      This is already enforced because it is part of the primary key.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
*   **Assumptions & Ambiguities**:
    *   Data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE, NUMERIC) were inferred based on common
        usage for such attribute names, as no data types were specified
        in the diagram.
    *   `Customers_Policies` and `First_Notification_of_Loss` are treated
        as strong entities because they have explicitly underlined primary
        keys (`Customers_Policies_ID` and `FNOL_ID` respectively), despite
        being represented by diamond shapes which typically denote
        relationships. In Chen notation, relationships can have attributes
        and even keys, effectively becoming associative entities that are
        handled as tables.
*   **Explanation**:
    *   Each identified strong entity (Customers, Services, Available_Policies,
        Customers_Policies, First_Notification_of_Loss, Claims, Settlements)
        has been translated into a `CREATE TABLE` statement.
    *   Attributes associated with each entity have been included as columns.
    *   The underlined attributes (`Customer_ID`, `Service_ID`, `Policy_ID`,
        `Customers_Policies_ID`, `FNOL_ID`, `Claim_ID`, `Settlement_ID`)
        have been designated as primary keys for their respective tables.
    *   No weak entities were identified as there were no partial keys
        (dashed underlines) and all diamond-shaped constructs had their
        own primary keys.

=== STEP 2 — WEAK ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    Customer_ID INT,
    Customer_name VARCHAR(255),
    PRIMARY KEY (Customer_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Services (
    Service_ID INT,

    Settlement_Amount NUMERIC(10, 2),
    Effective_Date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (Settlement_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
*   **Assumptions & Ambiguities**:
    *   No entities were identified as weak based on the rules (no partial
        keys or relationships indicating dependence without own strong identity).
*   **Explanation**:
    *   This step is skipped as no weak entities were identified in the ER
        diagram. The SQL code remains identical to Step 1.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
*   **Assumptions & Ambiguities**:
    *   No relationships were explicitly identified as 1:1.
*   **Explanation**:
    *   This step is skipped as no binary 1:1 relationships were identified
        in the ER diagram. The SQL code remains identical to the previous step.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
*   **Assumptions & Ambiguities**:
    *   The `(N:1)` notation near relationship lines was interpreted as 1-to-N,
        with '1' for the entity whose ID is specified in the notation (e.g.,
        `Available_Policies Policy_ID (N:1)` means 1 `Available_Policies` to
        N `Customers_Policies`).
    *   No total participation was indicated by double lines, so `NOT NULL`
        was not applied to the foreign keys.
*   **Explanation**:
    *   For each 1:N relationship, the primary key of the '1'-side entity
        was added as a foreign key to the 'N'-side entity's table.
    *   Specifically, `Customers_Policies` received `Customer_ID`, `Policy_ID`,
        and `Service_ID` as foreign keys.
    *   `Claims` received `FNOL_ID` as a foreign key.
    *   `Settlements` received `Claim_ID` as a foreign key.
    *   Foreign key constraints were added referencing the respective
        parent tables.

*   **Assumptions & Ambiguities**:
    *   The N:N relationship between `Customers_Policies` and
        `First_Notification_of_Loss` was resolved by creating a new
        associative table.
    *   The name `Customers_Policies_First_Notification_of_Loss` was
        chosen for the new join table to clearly indicate the entities
        it relates.
    *   No additional attributes were explicitly shown on the N:N
        relationship diamond itself, so the join table only contains
        the foreign keys that form its composite primary key.
*   **Explanation**:
    *   A new table, `Customers_Policies_First_Notification_of_Loss`,
        was created to resolve the N:N relationship between
        `Customers_Policies` and `First_Notification_of_Loss`.
    *   This join table includes the primary keys of both participating
        entities (`Customers_Policies_ID` and `FNOL_ID`) as its columns.
    *   These two columns together form the composite primary key of the
        new join table.
    *   Foreign key constraints were added to link these columns back to
        their respective original tables."

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - All rectangles in the diagram are interpreted as strong entities.
    - `CMI_Cross_References` has a composite primary key consisting of
      `cmi_cross_ref_id` and `source_system_code`, as both attributes are
      explicitly underlined.
    - All attributes (IDs and codes) are assigned the `TEXT` datatype
      because no specific datatypes were provided in the diagram.
- Explanation:
    - Each strong entity identified from the diagram has been mapped to a
      corresponding SQL table.
    - Attributes that were explicitly underlined in the diagram are designated
      as primary keys for their respective tables. Primary key columns are
      marked `NOT NULL`.
    - Primary key constraints are declared separately at the end of each
      table definition, adhering to the specified SQL conventions.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No weak entities were identified in the ER diagram based on visual
      cues such as double-lined rectangles or dashed underlined partial keys.
- Explanation:
    - Since no weak entities were found, no changes are made to the SQL

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - All binary relationships are identified as 1:M relationships. The 'N'
      side is the entity other than `CMI_Cross_References`, and the '1'
      side is `CMI_Cross_References`.
    - No total participation (double lines) is indicated in the diagram for
      any relationship, therefore, foreign key columns are nullable.
    - Anomaly: The relationship text for `Customer_Master_Index` states
      `Customer_Master_Index.master_customer_id -> CMI_Cross_References.master_customer_id`.
      This is anomalous because `CMI_Cross_References` does not have an
      attribute named `master_customer_id` explicitly drawn, and
      `master_customer_id` is the primary key of `Customer_Master_Index`.
      Given the `(N:1)` cardinality where 'N' is on the `Customer_Master_Index`
      side, the primary key of `CMI_Cross_References` should be the foreign
      key in `Customer_Master_Index`. This interpretation was prioritized.
    - Anomaly: All relationship texts, except the one noted above, specify
      `X_cmi_cross_ref_id -> CMI_Cross_References.cmi_cross_ref_id`. This
      explicitly mentions only `cmi_cross_ref_id` from the composite
      primary key of `CMI_Cross_References`. However, for a foreign key
      to be valid, it must reference the entire primary key of the parent
      table. Therefore, `source_system_code` (the other part of
      `CMI_Cross_References`'s composite PK) has been implicitly added as
      part of the foreign key in all 'M' side tables to ensure a valid FK.
- Explanation:
    - For each 1:M relationship, the primary key of the '1' side entity
      (`CMI_Cross_References`) is added as a foreign key to the 'M' side
      entity (e.g., `Electoral_Register`, `Customer_Master_Index`).
    - Since `CMI_Cross_References` has a composite primary key
      (`cmi_cross_ref_id`, `source_system_code`), both these attributes are
      added as foreign key columns to each related 'M' side table.
    - The `CMI_Cross_References` table creation is placed before all other
      tables that reference it to ensure foreign key dependencies are met.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
*   Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    *   Data types (VARCHAR, BOOLEAN) were inferred as they were not
        explicitly specified in the ER diagram. `id` is assumed to be
        `VARCHAR(50)` for flexibility, other string attributes
        as `VARCHAR(255)`.
    *   No explicit `NOT NULL` constraints were given beyond
        primary keys, but primary key attributes are inherently
        non-nullable, so `NOT NULL` is added.
*   Explanation:
    *   Two strong entities, `medicine` and `enzyme`, were identified
        and translated into separate tables.
    *   All simple attributes for each entity were included as columns.
    *   The `id` attribute for both `medicine` and `enzyme` was
        identified as the primary key due to being underlined.
    *   Primary key constraints are defined at the end of the table
        definition, each on its own line, as per the specified SQL
        conventions.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
*   Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    *   The `medicine_enzyme_interaction` entity is a weak entity
        identified by *two* strong entities (`medicine` and `enzyme`)
        and its partial key `interaction_type`. This is inferred
        from the double-rectangle notation and the two identifying
        relationships (double diamonds) linking it to both owners.
    *   Foreign keys `medicine_id` and `enzyme_id` are derived from
        the primary keys of their respective owner entities.
    *   `NOT NULL` is applied to all components of the composite
        primary key, including the foreign keys, because a weak entity
        cannot exist without its identifying owners.
    *   `ON DELETE CASCADE` is applied to the foreign keys, as
        stipulated for weak entities.
*   Explanation:
    *   The `medicine_enzyme_interaction` weak entity is created
        as a new table.
    *   Its primary key is a composite of the primary keys of its
        owner entities (`medicine.id` and `enzyme.id`) and its
        own partial key (`interaction_type`).
    *   Foreign keys are established to `medicine` and `enzyme`,

        integrity with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 5===
*   Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    *   The conceptual many-to-many interaction between `medicine`
        and `enzyme` is modeled as a weak entity (`medicine_enzyme_interaction`)
        rather than a direct M:N relationship with an associative table.
        This design choice in the ER diagram directly led to its
        handling in Step 2 as a weak entity.
*   Explanation:
    *   This step does not apply as there are no direct binary M:N
        relationships between strong entities that require a new
        join table to be created in this step.

CREATE TABLE camera_lens (
    id INTEGER,

    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types (INTEGER, VARCHAR(255), NUMERIC) were assumed as they were not
      explicitly provided in the diagram.
    - `id` attributes are assumed to be integers.
    - Text attributes like `brand`, `name`, `Country`, `Range`, `color` are
      assumed to be `VARCHAR(255)`.
    - Numeric attributes like `max_aperture`, `focal_length_mm`, `Prominence`,
      `Height` are assumed to be `NUMERIC` to handle potential decimal values.
    - All entities are identified as strong based on having a primary key and
      not being connected by identifying relationships (double lines/diamonds).
- Explanation
    - Each strong entity (`camera_lens`, `photos`, `mountain`) is mapped to a
      separate table.
    - The `id` attribute for each entity is identified as the primary key
      because it is underlined in the diagram.
    - Primary key constraints are added at the end of each table definition
      as specified by the rules.

=== STEP 2 — WEAK ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE camera_lens (
    id INTEGER,
    brand VARCHAR(255),

    name VARCHAR(255),
    Range VARCHAR(255),
    Height NUMERIC,
    PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No weak entities were identified in the diagram as there are no entities
      connected by a double diamond (identifying relationship) or having a
      dashed underlined partial key.
- Explanation
    - No changes were made in this step as no weak entities were present
      in the ER diagram.

=== STEP 3 — BINARY 1:1 (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE camera_lens (

);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No binary 1:1 relationships were identified in the diagram. All
      identified relationships are 1:N.
- Explanation
    - No changes were made in this step as no binary 1:1 relationships were
      present in the ER diagram.

=== STEP 4 — BINARY 1:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE camera_lens (
    id INTEGER,
    brand VARCHAR(255),

    FOREIGN KEY (camera_lens_id) REFERENCES camera_lens (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (mountain_id) REFERENCES mountain (id)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The cardinalities (N:1) for `photos` to `camera_lens` and `photos` to
      `mountain` clearly indicate 1:N relationships from the `1` side to the `N` side.
    - Total participation is not explicitly indicated by double lines in the
      Chen diagram. Therefore, the foreign key columns (`camera_lens_id`,
      `mountain_id`) are not marked `NOT NULL`.
    - The implicit relationship attributes `photos.camera_lens_id` and
      `photos.mountain_id` from the diagram's diamond text were mapped as
      foreign keys in the `photos` table.
- Explanation
    - The `photos` table is the ""many"" side in both 1:N relationships.
    - The primary key of `camera_lens` (`id`) is added as a foreign key
      (`camera_lens_id`) to the `photos` table.
    - The primary key of `mountain` (`id`) is added as a foreign key
      (`mountain_id`) to the `photos` table.
    - The `CREATE TABLE` statements for `camera_lens` and `mountain` are
      placed before `photos` to respect foreign key dependencies, as required.
    - Foreign key constraints are added at the end of the `photos` table
      definition as specified.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types are not specified in the ER diagram; assumed reasonable
      types: TEXT for IDs and string attributes, INTEGER for counts and
      ranking, NUMERIC for price.
    - No `NOT NULL` constraints were applied to non-primary key
      attributes as total participation was not explicitly indicated.
- Explanation:
    - Two strong entities, `market` and `phone`, are identified.
    - A table is created for each strong entity.
    - All simple attributes associated with each entity are included as
      columns in their respective tables.
    - The underlined attributes `Market_ID` and `Phone_ID` are set as
      the primary keys for the `market` and `phone` tables,
      respectively.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The weak entity `phone_market` is identified by both `market` and
      `phone` entities, as indicated by two identifying relationships
      (double diamonds).
    - As a weak entity, `phone_market` does not have a partial key
      explicitly shown. Its primary key is formed by the primary keys
      of its owner entities (`Market_ID` from `market` and `Phone_ID`
      from `phone`).
    - Foreign keys (`Market_ID`, `Phone_ID`) are assumed to be `NOT NULL`
      because the weak entity cannot exist without its identifying
      owners.
- Explanation:
    - A table `phone_market` is created for the weak entity.
    - It includes its own attribute `Num_of_stock`.
    - The primary key of `phone_market` is a composite key consisting
      of `Market_ID` (from `market`) and `Phone_ID` (from `phone`).
    - Foreign keys are added for `Market_ID` and `Phone_ID`, referencing
      the respective strong entities `market` and `phone`.
    - `ON DELETE CASCADE` is applied to both foreign keys to ensure that
      if an owner entity (market or phone) is deleted, the dependent
      `phone_market` entries are also removed.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The relationships from `market` to `phone_market` (1:N) and
      `phone` to `phone_market` (1:N) are handled by the weak entity
      mapping in Step 2.
- Explanation:
    - No direct non-identifying 1:N binary relationships were identified
      that required separate foreign key placement outside of the weak
      entity structure.
    - The `phone_market` table already incorporates the foreign keys
      from `market` and `phone` as part of its composite primary key,
      effectively handling the 1:N aspects of the identifying
      relationships from its owners.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 5===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The weak entity `phone_market`, identified by both `market` and
      `phone`, effectively models a many-to-many relationship between
      `market` and `phone` with an attribute (`Num_of_stock`).
- Explanation:
    - The `phone_market` table, created in Step 2 for the weak entity,
      serves as the join table for the implicit many-to-many
      relationship between `market` and `phone`.
    - Its composite primary key (`Market_ID`, `Phone_ID`) ensures
      uniqueness for each `market`-`phone` pair, and it holds the
      relationship attribute `Num_of_stock`.
    - Therefore, no new table or modifications are needed in this step
      as the structure for the M:N relationship is already complete."

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types were inferred based on typical usage for attribute names.
    - `_id` attributes are assumed to be `VARCHAR` as they are generic identifiers.
    - `Name`, `Street_address`, `Type`, `Location`, `Primary_Conference`, `Team`, `common_name`, `accession_number` are assumed to be `VARCHAR(255)`.
    - `Floors`, `Height_feet`, `Years_as_tallest`, `Enrollment`, `sequence_length` are assumed to be `INT`.
    - `Founded` is assumed to be an `INT` representing the year.
    - `sequence_identity_to_human_protein` and `divergence_from_human_lineage` are assumed to be `NUMERIC(5,3)` for fractional values.
    - The attribute `Institution` within the `Institution` entity is retained as is, despite having the same name as the entity, as per strict interpretation.
- Explanation
    - Each strong entity (building, Institution, protein) is mapped to a table.
    - All simple attributes for each entity are included as columns in their respective tables.
    - The attributes identified as primary keys (`building_id`, `Institution_id`, `protein_name`) based on the solid underline in the diagram, are designated as PRIMARY KEY constraints at the end of each table definition.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - There are no double-bordered rectangles for entities or dashed underlined attributes, which are visual cues for weak entities and partial keys in Chen notation.
- Explanation
    - No weak entities were identified in the ER diagram. Therefore, no additional tables or modifications for weak entities are made in this step.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - All identified relationships in the diagram are either 1:N or N:1, not 1:1.
- Explanation
    - No 1:1 relationships were identified in the ER diagram. Therefore, no modifications or new tables are made in this step.

    FOREIGN KEY (Institution_id) REFERENCES Institution (Institution_id)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The diamond text ""building.building_id -> Institution.building_id"" for the building-Institution relationship implies that `building_id` from `building` becomes a foreign key in `Institution`.
    - The diamond text ""protein.Institution_id -> Institution.Institution_id"" for the Institution-protein relationship implies that `Institution_id` from `Institution` becomes a foreign key in `protein`.
    - No total participation (double lines) was explicitly shown for the M-side of the relationships, so foreign keys are nullable.
- Explanation
    - The 1:N relationship between `building` (1-side) and `Institution` (N-side) is implemented by adding `building_id` (PK of `building`) as a foreign key in the `Institution` table. The `building` table is created before the `Institution` table to satisfy foreign key dependencies.
    - The 1:N relationship between `Institution` (1-side) and `protein` (N-side) is implemented by adding `Institution_id` (PK of `Institution`) as a foreign key in the `protein` table. The `Institution` table is created before the `protein` table to satisfy foreign key dependencies.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types (INT, VARCHAR) were assumed based on common
      database practices and attribute names.
    - Default lengths for VARCHAR fields were chosen as 255.
    - `Player_ID`, `Club_ID`, `Coach_ID` are assumed to be
      integer types, suitable for primary keys.
    - `Rank`, `Votes`, `Start_year` are assumed to be integer types.
- Explanation
    Strong entities `player`, `club`, and `coach` were mapped
    directly to SQL tables. Their underlined attributes
    (`Player_ID`, `Club_ID`, `Coach_ID`) were set as
    their respective primary keys and marked as NOT NULL.
    All other simple attributes were included as columns.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - `match_result` is a weak entity owned by `club` via
      an identifying relationship.
    - No partial key (dashed underline) was provided for
      `match_result` itself.
    - The N-cardinality for `match_result` in the identifying
      relationship with `club` implies that `Club_ID` alone
      cannot be its primary key.
- Explanation
    The `match_result` weak entity was mapped to a table.
    Since no partial key was indicated for `match_result`
    despite its N-cardinality on the weak side, a surrogate
    key `Match_Result_ID` was introduced to form a composite
    primary key `(Club_ID, Match_Result_ID)`. `Club_ID`
    is included as a foreign key referencing `club(Club_ID)`
    with `ON DELETE CASCADE` due to the identifying relationship
    and total participation of the weak entity. All attributes
    of `match_result` are included.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Participation for `player` and `coach` in the
      `match_result` relationship is assumed to be partial
      as no thick lines indicating total participation
      were present. Thus, `Player_ID` and `Coach_ID`
      foreign keys are nullable.
- Explanation
    The 1:N relationships between `player` and `match_result`
    (1:N) and `coach` and `match_result` (1:N) were
    resolved by adding foreign keys to the N-side table,
    `match_result`. `Player_ID` and `Coach_ID` columns
    were added to `match_result` with corresponding foreign
    key constraints.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 5===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The ambiguous labels and diamond-like shapes under
      `match_result` related to `player_coach` were
      interpreted as part of the M:N relationship between
      `player_coach` (as a table) and `match_result`.
- Explanation
    The M:N relationship between `player` and `coach` was
    resolved by creating an associative table `player_coach`.
    This table includes `Player_ID` and `Coach_ID` as a
    composite primary key and foreign keys to `player` and `coach`.
    The attribute `Starting_year` was added to this table.
    Another M:N relationship exists between `player_coach`
    (the associative table) and `match_result` (the weak entity table).
    This was resolved by creating a new join table
    `player_coach_match_result`. Its primary key is a composite
    of the primary keys of `player_coach` (`Player_ID`, `Coach_ID`)
    and `match_result` (`Club_ID`, `Match_Result_ID`), along
    with foreign key constraints to both tables."

    - Numerical attributes like 'Enrollment', 'Founded', 'Age' are assumed to be INTEGER.
    - 'Boys_or_Girls' and 'Day_or_Boarding' are assumed to be VARCHAR(255) to allow for flexible values.
- Explanation:
    - Two strong entities, `school` and `player`, are identified from the diagram.
    - Tables are created for each entity with their respective simple attributes.
    - The `School_ID` attribute for the `school` entity is explicitly underlined with a solid line, indicating it as the primary key.
    - The `Player_ID` attribute for the `player` entity is explicitly underlined with a solid line, indicating it as the primary key.

);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - For `school_details`, no partial key was explicitly underlined. As per the rule ""Do not invent surrogate keys unless the diagram lacks a key,"" and since `school_details` is a weak entity lacking its own key to form a composite, an `INTEGER` attribute `details_id` was invented to act as a partial key.
    - The attribute `Year_Entered_Competition` is connected to both the `school` entity and the `school_performance_School_ID` relationship diamond. This is an anomaly in the diagram. It's interpreted as an attribute of the `school_performance` weak entity, as it semantically relates to a school's performance in a competition.
- Explanation:
    - Two weak entities, `school_details` and `school_performance`, are identified.
    - For `school_details`, `school_School_ID` (from owner `school`) and the invented `details_id` form the composite primary key. `school_School_ID` is a foreign key to the `school` table. `NOT NULL` is applied to `school_School_ID` due to total participation.
    - For `school_performance`, `school_School_ID` (from owner `school`) and `School_Year` (its dashed-underlined partial key) form the composite primary key. `school_School_ID` is a foreign key to the `school` table. `NOT NULL` is applied to `school_School_ID` due to total participation.
    - Both foreign keys have `ON DELETE CASCADE` as per the rules for weak entities.
    - The `school` table is created before its dependent weak entities.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The `player_School_ID` relationship name suggests an implicit foreign key from `player` to `school`.
    - No total participation (thick line) is indicated for `player` in its relationship with `school`, so the foreign key `school_School_ID` in `player` is nullable.
- Explanation:
    - The `player_School_ID` relationship between `player` (N-side) and `school` (1-side) is processed.
    - The primary key of the 1-side entity (`school.School_ID`) is added as a foreign key (`school_School_ID`) to the N-side entity (`player`).
    - The foreign key is defined without `NOT NULL` as no total participation is indicated for the `player` entity.

Entities:
- ship
- mission

Attributes for ship:
- Ship_ID (Primary Key)
- Name
- Type
- Nationality
- Tonnage

Attributes for mission:
- Mission_ID (Primary Key)
- Launched_Year
- Location
- Speed_knots
- Code
- Fate

Relationships:
- A relationship exists between 'ship' and 'mission'.
- The relationship's cardinality is 1 (on the 'ship' side) to N (on the 'mission' side).
- The relationship is described by `mission.Ship_ID` pointing to `ship.Ship_ID`.

Notation:
- Chen Notation (indicated by rectangles for entities, ovals for attributes, diamonds for relationships, and '1', 'N' for cardinalities).

=== STEP 1 — STRONG ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE ship (
    Ship_ID INTEGER,
    Name TEXT,
    Type TEXT,
    Nationality TEXT,
    Tonnage INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Ship_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE mission (
    Mission_ID INTEGER,
    Launched_Year INTEGER,
    Location TEXT,
    Speed_knots INTEGER,
    Code TEXT,
    Fate TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (Mission_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for attributes (e.g., INTEGER, TEXT) were assumed based
      on common naming conventions and the nature of the data.
    - No explicit size or precision was given for numeric types.
- Explanation:
    - Two strong entities, 'ship' and 'mission', were identified from the
      diagram, each represented by a rectangle.
    - Their respective attributes were extracted from the ovals connected
      to them.
    - The 'Ship_ID' attribute for 'ship' and 'Mission_ID' for 'mission' were
      identified as primary keys because they were underlined in the diagram.
    - Each entity was mapped to a SQL CREATE TABLE statement, with attributes
      as columns and primary keys declared at the end of the table definition.

=== STEP 2 — WEAK ENTITIES (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE ship (
    Ship_ID INTEGER,
    Name TEXT,
    Type TEXT,
    Nationality TEXT,
    Tonnage INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Ship_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE mission (
    Mission_ID INTEGER,
    Launched_Year INTEGER,
    Location TEXT,
    Speed_knots INTEGER,
    Code TEXT,
    Fate TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (Mission_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - None.
- Explanation:
    - No weak entities were identified in the ER diagram. Weak entities
      are typically represented by double rectangles, and their identifying
      relationships by double diamonds, neither of which are present.
    - Therefore, no changes to the SQL code are made in this step.

=== STEP 3 — BINARY 1:1 (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE ship (
    Ship_ID INTEGER,
    Name TEXT,
    Type TEXT,
    Nationality TEXT,
    Tonnage INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Ship_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE mission (
    Mission_ID INTEGER,
    Launched_Year INTEGER,
    Location TEXT,
    Speed_knots INTEGER,
    Code TEXT,
    Fate TEXT,
    PRIMARY KEY (Mission_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 3===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - None.
- Explanation:
    - No binary 1:1 relationships were identified in the ER diagram.
      The only relationship shown is a 1:N relationship.
    - Therefore, no changes to the SQL code are made in this step.

=== STEP 4 — BINARY 1:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE ship (
    Ship_ID INTEGER,
    Name TEXT,
    Type TEXT,
    Nationality TEXT,
    Tonnage INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Ship_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE mission (
    Mission_ID INTEGER,
    Launched_Year INTEGER,
    Location TEXT,
    Speed_knots INTEGER,
    Code TEXT,
    Fate TEXT,
    Ship_ID INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Mission_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Ship_ID) REFERENCES ship (Ship_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - No total participation was explicitly indicated for the 'mission'
      side of the relationship (e.g., no thick line), so the foreign key
      'Ship_ID' in the 'mission' table is assumed to be nullable.
- Explanation:
    - A 1:N relationship was identified between 'ship' (1-side) and 'mission'
      (N-side). The relationship explicitly mentioned `mission.Ship_ID`
      referring to `ship.Ship_ID`.
    - To represent this in SQL, the primary key of the 1-side entity ('ship')
      ('Ship_ID') is added as a foreign key to the N-side entity ('mission').
    - A `FOREIGN KEY` constraint is added to the `mission` table,
      referencing the `Ship_ID` in the `ship` table.

=== STEP 5 — BINARY M:N (SQL) ===
CREATE TABLE ship (
    Ship_ID INTEGER,
    Name TEXT,
    Type TEXT,
    Nationality TEXT,
    Tonnage INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Ship_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE mission (
    Mission_ID INTEGER,
    Launched_Year INTEGER,
    Location TEXT,
    Speed_knots INTEGER,
    Code TEXT,
    Fate TEXT,
    Ship_ID INTEGER,
    PRIMARY KEY (Mission_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Ship_ID) REFERENCES ship (Ship_ID)
);

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 5===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - None.
- Explanation:
    - No binary M:N relationships were identified in the ER diagram.
      The only relationship shown is a 1:N relationship.
    - Therefore, no changes to the SQL code are made in this step."

- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - Data types for all attributes are assumed to be TEXT, except for date fields which are DATE.
      No explicit data types are provided in the ER diagram.
    - All IDs are assumed to be TEXT based on the general rule ""Do not assume attributes or keys based on names alone"".
- Explanation:
    - Three strong entities `Addresses`, `People`, and `Courses` are identified.
    - A `CREATE TABLE` statement is generated for each.
    - Attributes are mapped directly to columns.
    - Underlined attributes (`address_id`, `person_id`, `course_id`) are designated as primary keys.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 2===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - For `Students` and `Candidates`, their respective `student_id` and `candidate_id` are explicitly
      stated in the relationship diamonds as being equivalent to `People.person_id`. As such,
      `person_id` serves as both their primary key and foreign key.
    - For `Candidate_Assessments`, no partial key is underlined. Following the strict rule, the
      composite primary key consists only of the owner's primary key (`person_id` from `Candidates`).
      This implies a 1:1 relationship between `Candidates` and `Candidate_Assessments`, which is an
      anomaly given the entity name ""Assessments"" and the `assessment_date` attribute.
    - All relationships are identifying (double diamond), so `ON DELETE CASCADE` is applied to all
      foreign keys from weak entities to their owners.
    - The components of the composite primary keys in weak entities are implicitly `NOT NULL`.
- Explanation:
    - All weak entities are processed: `Students`, `Candidates`, `People_Addresses`,
      `Student_Course_Registrations`, `Student_Course_Attendance`, and `Candidate_Assessments`.
    - For `Students` and `Candidates`, `person_id` (inherited from `People`) becomes their primary key.
    - For `People_Addresses`, `address_id` (from `Addresses`), `person_id` (from `People`), and its own
      partial key `person_address_id` form the composite primary key.
    - For `Student_Course_Registrations`, `course_id` (from `Courses`), `person_id` (from `Students`),
      and its own partial key `registration_date` form the composite primary key.
    - For `Student_Course_Attendance`, the full primary key of `Student_Course_Registrations`
      (`course_id`, `person_id`, `registration_date`) plus its own partial key
      `date_of_attendance` form its composite primary key.
    - For `Candidate_Assessments`, as no partial key is specified, its primary key is solely `person_id`
      (inherited from `Candidates`).
    - Foreign keys are added to point to their respective owner entities, with `ON DELETE CASCADE`
      as per the rules for weak entities and identifying relationships.
    - The order of table creation is adjusted to ensure that entities referenced by foreign keys are
      created before the referencing entities.

- Explanation:
    - The diagram does not explicitly show any non-identifying M:N relationships that
      would require the creation of a separate join table in this step.
    - Entities like `People_Addresses` and `Student_Course_Registrations` appear to be
      associative entities for M:N relationships (`People` to `Addresses` and `Students`
      to `Courses`, respectively), but they are explicitly drawn as weak entities with
      identifying relationships. These were handled in Step 2 by including the PKs of
      their owner entities and their own partial keys in their composite primary keys.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 1===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - All entities are strong as there are no visual cues (like double rectangles)
      to indicate weak entities.
    - Data types for attributes are inferred: `BIGINT` for numerical IDs, `TEXT` for codes,
      names, descriptions, and details, and `DATE` for date fields.
    - Attributes marked as primary keys are assumed to be `NOT NULL`.
    - Other attributes are assumed to be nullable as no total participation or
      `NOT NULL` constraints are explicitly indicated by the diagram.
    - The rule ""All constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE) go at the bottom
      of the table definition, All constraints must be declared separately, each on its
      own line at the end of the column list."" takes precedence over the seemingly
      conflicting inline PRIMARY KEY rule, for consistency.
- Explanation:
    - Tables are created for each strong entity identified in the diagram:
      `Problem_Status_Codes`, `Problem_Category_Codes`, `Staff`, `Product`,
      `Problems`, and `Problem_Log`.
    - Each table includes its simple attributes.
    - The underlined attribute for each entity is assigned as its primary key.

=== EXPLANATION / ASSUMPTIONS / ANOMALIES FOR STEP 4===
- Assumptions & Ambiguities:
    - The `N:1` relationships are implemented by placing the primary key
      of the '1' side as a foreign key in the 'N' side table.
    - Since no total participation (double lines) is visually indicated
      for the N-side of these relationships, foreign keys are not marked
      as `NOT NULL`.
    - Relationship names like `Problem Log assigned_to_staff_id` or
      `Problems reported_by_staff_id` are used to name the foreign key
      attributes to distinguish them when an entity participates in
      multiple relationships with the same entity.
- Explanation:
    - The `Problems` table is updated with three foreign keys:
      `product_id` (from `Product`), `reported_by_staff_id` (from `Staff`),
      and `closure_authorised_by_staff_id` (from `Staff`).
    - The `Problem_Log` table is updated with four foreign keys:
      `problem_status_code` (from `Problem_Status_Codes`),
      `problem_category_code` (from `Problem_Category_Codes`),
      `assigned_to_staff_id` (from `Staff`), and `problem_id` (from `Problems`).
    - Table creation order has been adjusted to ensure that tables referenced
      by foreign keys are created before the tables that contain those foreign keys.
      Specifically, `Product`, `Staff`, `Problem_Status_Codes`, `Problem_Category_Codes`
      are created before `Problems` and `Problem_Log`. `Problems` is created before
      `Problem_Log` since `Problem_Log` references `Problems`.
